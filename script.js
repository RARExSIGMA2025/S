// This script is currently empty as no dynamic JavaScript was previously added for Sankalp Classes website.
// All interactive features were handled by pure HTML/CSS (smooth scrolling, hover effects) or Tailwind CSS.

// If you plan to add dynamic features (e.g., image lightboxes for the album,
// form validation beyond basic 'required', testimonials slider, etc.),
// you would add your JavaScript code here.

// Example of how you might add a simple interactive feature in the future:
/*
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // Example: A simple alert when clicking an album image (replace with a lightbox)
    const galleryImages = document.querySelectorAll('.gallery-image');
    galleryImages.forEach(image => {
        image.addEventListener('click', () => {
            // In a real scenario, you'd open a modal/lightbox here
            console.log('Image clicked:', image.alt);
            // alert(`You clicked on: ${image.alt}. (Replace this with a proper image viewer!)`);
        });
    });
});
